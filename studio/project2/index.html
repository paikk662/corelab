            <p>Growing up, this dish was something that my mom and grandmother always made for me at both meal and snacktimes. 
                It is a very popular street-food in Korea and has many different variations. 
                It is one of the very first dishes that I learned to cook, and this particular recipe is one of the simplest yet tastiest that I know.</p>

        <div style="margin-right:100px;">
            <ol>
                <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.
                <br>&emsp;</li>

                <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.
                <br>&emsp;</li>

                <li>Combine hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and kelp from the pot and then add the rice cake, the sauce mixture, the green onion, and the fish cakes and hard boiled eggs if wanted. The stock will measure about 2 1/2 cups. 
                <br>&emsp;</li>

                <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Keep stirring until the rice cake turns soft and the sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should take about 10 to 15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until softened.
                <br>&emsp;

                <br>[NOTE] When you use freshly made rice cake, it takes a shorter time to cook through. If you are using frozen rice cake, thaw it first and then soak in cold water to soften it before cooking.
                <br>&emsp;</li>

                <li>Remove from the heat and serve hot.</li>
