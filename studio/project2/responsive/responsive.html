            <p>Growing up, this dish was something that my mom and grandmother always made for me at both meal and snacktimes. 
                It is a very popular street-food in Korea and has many different variations. 
                It is one of the very first dishes that I learned to cook, and this particular recipe is one of the simplest yet tastiest that I know.</p>
