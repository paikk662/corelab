            The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by — 
            the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool — 
            she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, 
            and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution — 
            once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it — 
            once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, 
            filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.
            </p>
            <p>
            So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, 
            though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality — 
            the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds — 
            the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy — 
            and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard — 
            while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; 
            and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: 
            and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, 
            perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, 
            and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
